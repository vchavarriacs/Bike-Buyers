# Bike-Buyers
 The data has been cleaned to remove null and replicated values, and pivot tables have been created to interpret the information. The data is divided by whether a bike was purchased.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel

# Project Structure
Data: Contains the raw data files, working sheet for cleaning, pivot tables sheet for data exploration and chart creation and dashboard sheet for gathering all the charts and filter for an easier use. 
Analysis: Contains the Excel file with the cleaned data and pivot tables.
Getting Started
To run the analysis, open the Excel file in the Analysis folder.

# Usage
The pivot tables in the Excel file provide insights into bike purchases based on different factors such as income per gender, commute distance, sum of cars per age bracket, region and home ownership, and children's age bracket. There are three filters available for the charts of the pivot tables where users can filter by 'Marital Status', Region (when it's not included), and Education.

# Results
The analysis provides valuable insights into bike purchasing behavior based on demographic factors. For example, it shows how income varies by gender, how commute distance affects bike purchases, the distribution of cars across age brackets, and the relationship between region and home ownership.

# Future Improvements
Future improvements to the project could include more detailed analysis of specific demographic groups, integration with other data sources for more comprehensive insights, and the creation of visualizations to enhance understanding of the data.
